main menu with example play

replaceRemoved - need to eliminate the blocks to be removed, shift ones above and to the left in, then refill the corresponding cols
		May be some double counting issues, so this function needs to be robust against them. may require
		changes to addblocks to detect when the array is already full

drawMessages - indications to the user if the swap was legal or not, needs animations

sprites

animations - rotation for eliminated blocks
	*** there will be double counting in the g['toRemove'] array, but a simple search for applying the rotation should
	*** ignore this.
