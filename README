Instructions:
- Professor Kosbie hasn’t slept in days!

- Your mission is to help him get through this puzzling maze of TAs to his
  peaceful bed.

- To help Kosbie make it through the maze, you can click on a TA like Tomer’s
  face to highlight them.

- We want Tomer to form a row of three or more Tomer’s. After highlighting
  Tomer, if swapping Tomer with one of his neighbors, like Brandon, forms a row
  of three Tomers, you can click on that neighbor to swap them. Then all three
  Tomers disappear!

- With a poof, the three Tomer’s are gone. The course staff above the row of
  Tomers drop down and are replaced by more TAs from above.

- If the three Tomers had instead been in a horizontal row, the course staff
  would have slid to the right and been replaced by more TAs from the left.

- You will clear away TAs along the rows and column Professor Kosbie’s occupies,
  gradually bringing him down and to the right, until he reaches his bed!


Core Week 1 Ideas:
- Images of Professor Kosbie and each TA are included. We rotate images of
  Professor Kosbie's face with a speech bubble showing his need to get some
  rest.
- We of course use JavaScript and Canvas to put this all together. We use
  functions as variables, as well as arrays and objects.
